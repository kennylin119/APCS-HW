Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Wow really cool intro but my wifi is really slow so this isn't loading very well. I can't believe Neil de Grasse Tyson's son goes to our school. I can't believe I know him :0

"We've come a long way together" -- yup defintely
Experiment? what experiment??
	    This is really cool music tho
	    Oh a thought experiment
	    Sure any star.
	    	 Center of universe... like us?
		 Ah i get it its a metaphor
		    Columbus's time,
		    North and south america weren't even discovered yet
		    YAYY cartoon
	    Radioactivty? In the airrr???? Why arent we dead yet then 
	         Oh from the sun right
		 Hydrogen balloon omg stay safe
		 Damn twice as strong-- earth's atmosphere absorbs some of it
		      Solar eclipse experiment
		      	    No effect
			    Just as strong in daylight as night time
			    Concluded not from sun-- right but for wrong reasons
	   Actual answer is cosmic rays
	   	  Winds don't move them around rapidly
		  Woowww how dense- neutron stars
		  Pulsars = spin rapidly with energy
Oh I should prob start a new tab
1970s- Rubins verified the existence of dark matter
       Thats such a cool name
       	     Invisible but affects planets gravity
	     Ten times more massive than we thought we knew
       But wait theres more! Dark energy :0
       	     Star dies --> black hole
	     These animations are insane omg
       Supernova = more light than the combined light from rest of stars
             500 times light of the sun wow
	     same light used to measure distance from solar systems
Universe expanding - discovered by Hubbles
       14 billion years ago, big bang
       dark matter enough bring universe back after a certain point
       if not enough then the universe just slows down
       However, universe expansion is speeding up!
       		Unknown force doing this
		dark energy- term for something we don't know is
Only two ships have been to interstellar space
     Voyagers one and two
     	      40,000 miles per hour
	      Close up look of Jupiter's great red spot
	      Discovered first active volcano on other world, Io
	      Ocean beneath Europa, twice as much water as earth
	      Saturn's rigns are made of orbiting snowballs
	      Hydrocarbon seas on titan
	      Neptune winds roar at 40,000 miles an hour
	      Triton- geysers of nitrogen
    35 years after launch, entered uncharted realm
       	     Sun solar wind- heliosphere
	     extends beyond outermost planets
Oops I fell asleep
Woww geologic clock lets go
     Microbial mass woot
HUH every corrupt polician?
    Oh yeah we live together on earth
    "small stage in a vast cosmic arena"
    Yes i love these cartoons
    	Questions authorithy, no idea is true just because someone said so... including me
	PREACH
	Believing something doesnt make it so-- thats a fallacy
	Most important rule = you can be wrong... every scientist in history has made mistakes. It's totally ok!
	     this documentary is so wholesome i love it  
Cool story bro. I'm ready for part 2 or i guess 3?

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
That spaceship looks so cool omg
     I want one please??
     So this is a remake of the one done by Carl Sagan huh
     Alan Silversti does good music

AWWWWW baby
       Harry potter much?
       Wait brb let me get some popcorn
These animations are so well done and they're really nice for conveying info
Primitive people - created explanations for events
     Comets were proponents of doom
     Greek - "bad star"
     Zulu war, jaguar smallpox, death of leader, etc
     Chinese started recording catalog of cormet,
     	     Patterns meant diff things
	     However, false pattern recognition is a thing
     	     All too eager to deceive ourselves, center of universe
Oh the ship is imagination :((
   So i cant have it
   *travels to mysterious realm* wow ok
   Ooh glowing halo AND A TAIL
       layers tell story of how comets were made, some 4 billion years ago
       prionsers of earth 4,000 years ago
       		 could only look up

Issac Newton + Edmund Howley - finally set us free
      comet 1664 shivers of dread
      	    plague and fire of london followed soon after
      Howley dropped out of Oxford for exploration to St. Helena
      	     Coffee shops all over london
	     I swear I type up the weirdest things
	       This was where people exchanged news, debates, laboratory of democracy
	       Discuss mystery, why do planets move as they do?
	       	       Actually elipses orbits
		       Closer to sun, faster the orbit
       Brook's law of elasticty?
       	       Like OUR brooks?
	       Hooke couldn't do math, Howley gave up on him. Awww
       	       Isaac newton solved mystery of refraction of light. Hooke betrayed him
               	     met up with howley and teamed together
		     calculated everything 5 years ago already

Wanted to publish book but Royal Society blew all their money printing books of fish?
       Couldn't publish Newton's masterpiece
       Had to pay Newton with books of fish 
       However, wait is his name Hailey?
       		Resolved to edit, and publish book at his own expense
		Newton made 3 volumes, third settled coffehouse debate
	Hooke wanted acknowledgement for law of gravity
	      Confronted him, but eventually forced him to back down
	      Oh and also Newton invented Calculus
	      highkey a genious
	By finding natural laws, Newton also decoupled heavens from ancient ideas
	      Hailey was also a genius
	      Known for discoering comet, but one of few things he actually never did
	      OHHHHH wait i get it Hailey's comet right
	      	     Made first map of earth's magenetic field
		     Perfected diving bell, started salving operation
		     	       pERSONALLY tested his own invention v dangerous 
		     Invented weather map, symbols still used today
		     Actual scale of solar system
	True pattern recognition-- finding out the return of comets, every several years
	     Hailey stated when exactly and where the comet would return
	     Prophesy by mystics no where near as close precision
	     Free fall around sun
	     Gravity pulls towards sun, but orbital momentum means they go around
	Newton replaced Hooke as president of Royal Society
	       Hailey final act was to ask for a glass of wine, down it and die
	       Hailey's comet every 76 years will come around
	       1986, 2061 will be back
Wonder, not fear
	Because of SCIENCE :D
