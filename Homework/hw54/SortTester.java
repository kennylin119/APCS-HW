	  The algorithm will still split the array into two parts,
	  sorted and unsorted but because all the elements are 
	  already in order, no swaps will be made. Since comparisons 
	  require less processing power than swaps, this will reduce

	  compares the first element of the unsorted array with those of the 
	  sorted array, starting with the highest element and swapping until
	  it reaches its point of insertion. Since the array is in reverse
	  order, the next element in the sorted array will always be the next
	  smallest element in the array, meaning that it will have to compare
	  and swap with each element in the sorted array every pass. This 
	  results in the most number of passes and swaps possible making this 
	  the worst case for insertion sort.
